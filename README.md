# `t2v-eval`: visual evaluation for top text-to-video models

[t2v-eval.com](https://t2v-eval.com) is a solution to visually compare state-of-the-art open source text-to-video (T2V) models.

Models featured:
* [OpenSora v1.2](https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora)
* [CogVideo](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo)
* [PyramidFlow](https://github.com/gasharper/PyramidFlow)

*We are working to include the best open-source T2V models available.*

How it works:  
I generated outputs from a diverse set of prompts on each model and I put the output side-by-side for visual comparison. The prompts are not cherry picked so as to provide an unbiased base for comparison of model performance). I did however includ some popular prompts (eg "Will Smith eating spaghetti") for the meme.


Key take-aways I will go over:
* CogVideo outperforms OpenSora and PyramidFlow
* Some prompts are difficult for all models, others are easy for all models
* Prompt densification is a useful strategy to improve some aspect of the generation quality


## 1. CogVideo outperforms OpenSora and PyramidFlow

## 2. Things most challenging for all models

## 3. Prompt densification is a valuable takeaway
